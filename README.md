# center-everything
Requires jQuery. 
Using a class call, you will be able to center (vertically and/or horizontally) any div (or any other html entity, but I will be referring to divs) based on the parent div's height/width. Removes the hustle off your hands, especially when it comes to vertical centering. Works on all browsers. 

Simple, lightweight and customizable.

Include the file, add class name to the div that needs to be centered and that is it.

Original class names: "center-content-vertically" and "center-content-horizontally". This can be modified to anything you want.
